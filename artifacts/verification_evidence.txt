Application ID: 1519689
Auth token (authResponse): 9659704eb4dc2d2e148e87c705866398de04c572
Website URL (applied with): https://phoenixcreeksupply.com/

Where the tag was placed (repository files and locations):
- app/layout.js — added the exact script tag inside the <head> so it's present in the homepage HTML.
  Path: app/layout.js (head section)

Static confirmation files (placed at web root):
- /public/affiliate_app_confirm.html

Notes / troubleshooting tips for AvantLink support:
- The script uses the exact tag provided by AvantLink (HTTP URL and authResponse). If their verifier does not execute JS, the static files include the plaintext token.
- If the verifier still can't find the token on the homepage, please try the explicit static file URL: https://phoenixcreeksupply.com/affiliate_app_confirm.html
- If AvantLink requires HTTPS for their fetch of the external vendor script, ask them to support the HTTPS variant of their host if available (https://classic.avantlink.com/...)

Screenshots: (I cannot create a live screenshot of your deployed site from this environment.)
- To create a screenshot for AvantLink support, open the homepage in a browser, open View -> Developer -> View Page Source and take a screenshot showing the script tag and the authResponse token.
