Subject: Request to manually confirm affiliate application — App ID 1519689

Hello AvantLink team,

I applied for an affiliate account (Application ID: 1519689) and I’m unable to complete the automated website verification step. Please manually confirm our application.

Details:
- Application ID: 1519689
- Website URL: https://phoenixcreeksupply.com/
- Email used to apply: monroe@phoenixcreeksupply.com

Verification evidence:
- I installed the exact JavaScript tag you requested on the homepage HTML (in the <head>). The tag is:
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://classic.avantlink.com/affiliate_app_confirm.php?mode=js&authResponse=9659704eb4dc2d2e148e87c705866398de04c572"></script>

- I also added a plain HTML comment in the homepage head so the auth token is present in the raw HTML page source (for verifiers that don't execute JS):
  <!-- AvantLink authResponse: 9659704eb4dc2d2e148e87c705866398de04c572 -->

- Static confirmation files are available at these direct URLs:
  - https://phoenixcreeksupply.com/affiliate_app_confirm.html
  - https://phoenixcreeksupply.com/affiliate_app_confirm.php
  - https://phoenixcreeksupply.com/affiliate-verify.html

- Plaintext token included for non-JS verification:
  authResponse: 9659704eb4dc2d2e148e87c705866398de04c572

Verification checks I performed (server-side fetches):
- Homepage contains the token and the exact script tag.
- Static files (affiliate_app_confirm.html and affiliate_app_confirm.php) contain the token.

Please use either the homepage or the static URL (recommended) to verify the application:
https://phoenixcreeksupply.com/affiliate_app_confirm.html

If you need a screenshot of the homepage source showing the tag and token, or a different filename/location to check, let me know and I will provide it immediately.

Thanks for your help,
Monroe
