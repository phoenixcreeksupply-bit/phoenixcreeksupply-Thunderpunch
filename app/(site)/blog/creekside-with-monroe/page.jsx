        There was a time when neighbors weren’t strangers. When a man could rely
        on the people within walking distance more than the people online.
      </p>

      <p>
        These days, most folks keep their eyes down and their doors shut. The
        word “community” gets thrown around but rarely lived out.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t build connection through convenience — you build it through
        willingness. Through showing up. Through the hard days that make good
        people rise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe we lost the sense of shared responsibility. Maybe people just got
        softer. Maybe everyone’s too busy surviving their own storms to notice
        anyone else’s.
      </p>

      <p>
        But every now and then, you meet someone cut from the old cloth — someone
        who shows up without being asked, who checks in, who gives a damn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those people still exist. They’re rare, but they’re out there.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you’re one of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep being the kind of man who strengthens the ground around him. Even
        when others have forgotten how.
      </p>

      <p>Lead yourself. Live with intent. The rest follows.</p>
