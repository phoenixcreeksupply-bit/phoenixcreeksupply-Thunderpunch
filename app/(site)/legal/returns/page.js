        Phoenix Creek Supply is a digital-first company. Due to the nature of our 
        digital products (downloadable guides, maps, and kits), all sales are final 
        and non-refundable once the product is delivered.

        For physical affiliate-linked products purchased via third parties (e.g. Amazon),
        their return and refund policies apply. Please refer to the respective sellerâ€™s 
        terms directly.
