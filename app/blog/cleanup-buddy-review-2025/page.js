        The Micro-Gold Workhorse Every Prospector Should Own
      </p>

      {/* INTRO */}
      <p>
        Fine gold is where most prospectors win or lose — and it’s usually where
        gear begins to fail. The{" "}
        <strong>Dream Mat Cleanup Buddy</strong> changes that. It’s a compact,
        high-efficiency cleanup system designed to strip black sand away and
        lock micro-gold instantly, with almost zero effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        After PCS field testing in Montana gravels, buckets of cons, and dredge
        leftovers, one thing became clear:
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold text-yellow-300">
        The Cleanup Buddy isn’t an accessory — it’s an advantage.
      </p>

      {/* WHAT IT IS */}
      <h2 id="what-it-is">What the Cleanup Buddy Actually Is</h2>

      <p>
        The Cleanup Buddy is a purpose-built miniature sluice powered by Dream
        Mat’s micro-vortex technology. Unlike old-school riffles or carpet, each
        cell creates a controlled low-pressure trap that locks gold while
        lighter material flushes cleanly out.
      </p>

      <p>This translates into:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Less turbulence</li>
        <li>Less blowout</li>
        <li>More gold recovered — especially under 100 mesh</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For Montana, Idaho, Oregon, New Mexico, and any fine-gold region, this
        system is brutally effective.
      </p>

      <hr />

      {/* WHY IT MATTERS */}
      <h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters (and Why PCS Recommends It)</h2>

      <p>
        Most prospectors lose fine gold without ever knowing it. Traditional
        cleanup sluices simply can’t control micro-material without excessive
        turbulence or washout.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Cleanup Buddy solves that by controlling water velocity inside each
        micro cell. Gold drops instantly. Lights flush out. Your recovery becomes
        predictable.
      </p>

      <h3>PCS Field Notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Captures gold that pans and standard mats miss</li>
        <li>Processes heavy cons in minutes</li>
        <li>Runs on low water volume</li>
        <li>Zero learning curve — dial flow once, done</li>
        <li>Portable enough for pack-in prospecting</li>
      </ul>

      {/* WHAT YOU CAN RUN */}
      <h2 id="what-you-can-run">What You Can Run Through It</h2>

      <p>This system excels with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Black sand concentrates</li>
        <li>Sluice or highbanker cons</li>
        <li>Dredge tailings</li>
        <li>Blue Bowl leftovers</li>
        <li>Miller table overs</li>
        <li>Raw creek pan material</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If it fits in a scoop and contains gold, the Cleanup Buddy will show you
        exactly what you caught — and what you would have lost.
      </p>

      {/* SETUP */}
      <h2 id="setup">Recommended Setup</h2>

      <p>Run it simple. Run it clean. Here's the optimized setup:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>800–1100 GPH bilge pump</li>
        <li>¾" reinforced hose</li>
        <li>Shallow recirculation tub</li>
        <li>Level tray — do not steepen the pitch</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        High flow is not the objective —{" "}
        <strong>consistent, controlled water is.</strong>
      </p>

      <hr />

      {/* ACCESSORIES */}
      <h2 id="accessories">Best Accessories to Pair With It</h2>

      <p>To build a complete micro-gold recovery station:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>800–1100 GPH pump</li>
        <li>12V 9Ah sealed lead acid battery</li>
        <li>¼" or ⅛" classifier</li>
        <li>Snuffer bottle and fine vials</li>
        <li>Finishing pan</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Each of these improves speed and precision during cleanup — especially with
        ultra-fine gold.
      </p>

      <hr />

      {/* SHOULD YOU BUY */}
      <h2 id="should-you-buy">Should You Buy One?</h2>

      <p>You should if:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You prospect in fine-gold country</li>
        <li>You process more than a few gallons of cons per week</li>
        <li>You want consistent, repeatable recovery</li>
        <li>You want more gold in the vial — not in the tailings</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="font-semibold text-yellow-300">
        For claim owners, highbanker operators, and serious weekend miners — the
        Cleanup Buddy pays for itself fast.
      </p>

      {/* CLOSING */}
      <h2 id="closing">Closing — The PCS Verdict</h2>

      <p>
        Gold recovery isn’t luck — it’s systems, gear, and discipline. The
        Cleanup Buddy is one of the rare tools that improves your results without
        adding complexity or maintenance overhead.
      </p>

      <p>
        It earns its place in the pack because it consistently recovers gold that
        lesser systems lose. Simple. Effective. Field-tested.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold">
        In a world where fine gold makes the difference, the Cleanup Buddy is the
        edge.
